Vue.js project created using the Vue CLI webpack-simple template to use Axios and MomentJS for data fetching and date formatting.

``` bash
$ vue init webpack-simple infinite-scroll-vuejs
```

a GET service method with Axios to fetch another Reddit posts from the Reddit API.

Rules for using the reddit API:
- You must read the terms and register in order to use the Reddit API, to then get the client ID and Secure Key to get authentication to call the API
- All API clients must authenticate with OAUTH 2
- All API clients must follow the API rules: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API


##The Logic behind Implementing the Infinite Scroll:

Once we get the initial data (25 reddit Posts)  we create a new function scroll() and have it loaded in the mounted() lifecycle method. 

This scroll() method calculates the bottom of the page to know if its reached or not which means that it will evaluates it as true or false. For this, we use  the documentElement.scrollTop, documentElement.offsetHeight properties and of windowâ€™s innerHeight properties to find out if scroll is at the bottom.
